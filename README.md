# Python Challenge Projects

This repository contains two Python-based data analysis projects focused on financial and election data. Both projects demonstrate the ability to import, clean, analyze, and summarize large datasets using core Python libraries.

## Projects Overview

### 1. PyBank: Financial Analysis

Analyzes budget data over a multi-year period to calculate key financial metrics.

#### Analysis Includes:
- Total months of data
- Net total amount of profit/losses
- Average change in profit/losses between months
- Greatest increase in profits (date & amount)
- Greatest decrease in losses (date & amount)

---

### 2. PyPoll: Election Analysis

Analyzes election data to calculate and report voting results.

#### Analysis Includes:
- Total number of votes cast
- List of candidates who received votes
- Total number of votes each candidate won
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- Winner of the election based on popular vote
