# python-challenge
This repository contains all the information pertaining to Week 3 challenge. 

This week's challenge had two parts. These two parts will be called PyPoll and PyBank.

I leveraged class notes, tutoring support, and AskBCS to complete the assignment. 

In the PyBank assignment, I leveraged AskBCS support for clarifying the index function. I also leveraged tutoring for figuring out min and max functions.

In the PyPoll assignment, I leveraged AskBCS to better understand the dictionary function.

I leveraged Google to clarify how to format the values. I also leveraged Google on how to commit changes to the repository once the assignment was complete, which is why changes weren't made at multiple stages throughout completing the assignment.
